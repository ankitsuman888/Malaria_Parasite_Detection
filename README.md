# Malaria_Parasite_Detection

Malaria is a blood disease caused by parasites transmitted through the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. If not detected and treated early, severe illness can develop, often leading to death. Despite ongoing efforts to prevent the disease, an estimated 219 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide in 2017 alone, according to a 2018 World Health Organization report. More than two thirds of all cases occur in children under 5.

Early detection not only reduces the disease and prevent deaths, it also helps to limit transmission. However, the diagnosis requires expert examination of thick and thin blood smear slide images. This manual process depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting parasitized and uninfected cells.
